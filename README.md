# Dotnet AI

This repository brings together various AI-related projects in .NET including APIs, a NuGet package and serverless examples for integrating large language models like `OpenAI`, `Claude`, and `DeepSeek` 
and serves as a long-term workspace for building and sharing AI capabilities in the .NET ecosystem.

 [`Dotnet AI Core`](https://github.com/horia-apostol/dotnet-ai/tree/main/dotnet-ai-core)  
  The initial API implementation, with provider-specific clients and routing logic. Serves as the foundation for further abstractions and experimentation.

 [`Dotnet AI SDK`](https://github.com/horia-apostol/dotnet-ai/tree/main/dotnet-ai-sdk)  
  A NuGet package that provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple LLM providers.

 [`Dotnet AI Functions`](https://github.com/horia-apostol/dotnet-ai/tree/main/dotnet-ai-functions)  
  An Azure Function example that exposes an HTTP endpoint using the NuGet package.
